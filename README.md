# PathFindingBFS

Using the breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithm to make an interactive, visual, basic pathfinding playground.

**LEFT MOUSE CLICK** = set a green square ('destination' square).  
**RIGHT MOUSE CLICK** = set a black square ('wall' square).  
**R key** = reset the playground.

- You will need to install SDL2 for this project if you want to build it yourself (the SDL2 files were to large to be uploaded to git).
