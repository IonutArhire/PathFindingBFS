# PathFindingBFS

This is a project that I started right after my first year of computer science and that I revised and optimized right before my third year. That being said, the code quality is probably still not near to being the best and so any opinions about possible improvements are welcome.

Using the breadth-first-search (BFS) algorithm and SDL2 I managed to create an interactive, visual pathfinding playground.

**LEFT MOUSE CLICK** = set a green square ('destination' square).  
**RIGHT MOUSE CLICK** = set a black square ('wall' square).  
**R key** = reset the playground.

*You will need to install SDL2 for this project if you want to build it yourself (the SDL2 files were to large to be uploaded to git).*
